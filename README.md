# Library

This is the library project for The Odin Project. The goal for this project is to use prototype inheritance by creating a prototype function to use for each instance, in this case, book card. 

My idea for this website was inspired by the dewey-decimal system and classic book index cards with tabs and stamps from the checkout book form in the back of library books.

This website is mobile-responsive, using clamps, grid and flexbox. There is button for my "Tommy's library" that will display 18 of my favorite books. There is a button to organize alphabetically. A button to change the display, and a button to add more boooks. The cabinet drawers are also interactive, displaying a deck of six cards when opened.

The pictures of the book covers in "Tommy's library" come from screenshots on Google Books. The SVGs come from Google. I added a '+' to the 'Add book' svg. 'Secret Typewriter Font' is from https://fontsquirrel.com.
